					<h1>Meet Single LDS People</h1>
					<p>We're all probably a bit bored (and maybe even a little alone) during these interesting times. For some time we've wanted to set our favorite LDS friends up with each other, but now we finally have a excuse to do so!</p>
					<p>All you have to do is fill out a 10-ish minute questionnaire (most easily done on a computer or tablet).</p>
					<button><a href="https://forms.gle/zgLDcekwzmrpypxC9" style="text-decoration: none; margin-bottom:1.4em;">Click here start meeting people</a></button>
					<p> You'll then indicate whether you'd like to be connected with them (at this point via email, in the future likely something similar to Snapchat). If you both say yes, you'll receive an introductory email. After a few days we'll follow up and see what you thought&mdash;the feedback you give will be used to further refine your potential matches.</p>
				</div>
				<div="section-block">
					<h2>How Am I Matched?</h2>
					<p>Great question. You are presented with potential matches who most closely meet the preferences you indicate (and whose preferences you suit) in your <a href="https://forms.gle/zgLDcekwzmrpypxC9">introductory questionnaire</a>.</p>
					<p>This is still work in progress, so please feel free to reach out to <a href="mailto:findpeoplelikeyou@gmail.com">findpeoplelikeyou@gmail.com</a> with any questions or feedback.</p>
				</div>
				<div="section-block">
					<h2>(Probably) The Most Important Part</h2>
					<p>You likely have friends who you are (very) surprised are still single and it is important that you invite them to join, too.</p>
					<p>The central idea of this project is that our friends (and friends' friends) know so many great people that if we all brining our favorite people, we'll all find someone&mdash;while you might not want to date your friends, someone else certainly does.</p>
