					<h1>Meet Single LDS People</h1>
					<p>We're all probably a bit bored (and maybe even a little alone) during these interesting times. For some time we've wanted to set our favorite LDS friends up with each other, but now we finally have an excuse to do so!</p>
					<p>All you have to do is fill out a 10-ish minute questionnaire (most easily done on a computer or tablet).</p>
					<button><a href="https://forms.gle/zgLDcekwzmrpypxC9">Click here to start meeting people</a></button>
				</div>
				<div id="what-is-the-process" class="section-block">
					<h2>How The Process Works</h2>
					<p>Once you fill out your information, you'll be sent a few potential matches and be able to indicate whether you'd like to be introduced to them. If you both say "yes", you'll receive an introductory email and you two can take it from there.</p>
					<p>After a few days we'll follow up and see what you thought&mdash;the feedback you give will be used to further refine your potential matches.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="how-am-i-matched" class="section-block">
					<h2>How Am I Matched?</h2>
					<p>Great question. You are presented with potential matches who most closely meet the preferences you indicate (and whose preferences you suit) in your <a href="https://forms.gle/zgLDcekwzmrpypxC9">introductory questionnaire</a>; your suitability is determined by an alogrithm. <i>NB</i>: The algorithm only considers personality, cultural, and attitudinal factors&mdash;anything else (e.g physical appearance) is controlled by who you indicate that you would like to be paried with when you receive potential matches.</p>
					<p>This is still work in progress, so please feel free to reach out to <a href="mailto:findpeoplelikeyou@gmail.com">findpeoplelikeyou@gmail.com</a> with any questions or feedback.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section-block">
					<h2>(Probably) The Most Important Part</h2>
					<p>You likely have friends who you are (very) surprised are still single&mdash;it would be wonderful if you'd invite them to join, too.</p>
					<p>The central idea of this project is that our friends (and friends' friends) know so many great people that we'll each find someone if we all bring our favorite people&mdash;while you might not want to date your friends, someone else certainly does.</p>
